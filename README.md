# Advent of Code 2025 Solutions #

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025/) using C++23.

The included CMake project will download the required dependencies and allow you to build the solution for each day.

Note that the project uses C++ modules (including the `std` module) and so requires an up-to-date compiler and CMake version.

Libraries used:

 * [Flux](http://github.com/tcbrindle/flux)
 * [CTRE](https://github.com/hanickadot/compile-time-regular-expressions)
 * [ankerl::unordered_dense](https://github.com/martinus/unordered_dense)
